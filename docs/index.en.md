P-KISS-SBC, is a simple SIP Proxy, easy to learn, fast to deploy, ready for production

## Why P-KISS-SBC ?

Numerous SIP / SBC Proxy or even SIP gateway solutions exist. 
Although the range may seem large, in reality there are 2 types of solution:

* complete solutions, but complex to implement and operate. The entry ticket in terms of infrastructure (server and/or licence) is high. Finally, the day-to-day management skills (SIP peer creation, SIP debugging, etc.) require a good deal of training.
* frameworks, often OpenSource, such as Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk, FreeSwitch, Yate, etc., which allow you to develop your own in-house solution, but which require you to be familiar with the SIP/RTP protocols and these solutions.
